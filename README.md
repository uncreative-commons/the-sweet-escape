The Sweet Escape (aka, candies)
=======
This is our submission for the 2013 51-hour long HGDA game jam.

Realtime multiplayer platforming game with shared arena. Uses node.js + socket.io for sync,
phaser.js for rendering. Tilemaps edited with tiled, artwork mostly created in Photoshop.

The general gameplay idea is cooperative platformer/puzzle solving with friends or other internet anons.

It is running live @ http://uncreative.korny.cc/. iOS & android are actually supported, 
with Onscreen controls, but there might be some scaling issues.


How to run it locally
--------------
Assuming you have node.js installed, npm install && npm start should fetch all deps and run a local instance.
