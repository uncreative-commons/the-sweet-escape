The Sweet Escape (aka, candies)
=======
This is our submission for the 2013 51-hour long HGDA game jam (http://www.hellenicgamejam.com)

Realtime multiplayer platforming game with shared arena. Uses node.js + socket.io for sync,
phaser.js for rendering. Tilemaps edited with tiled, artwork mostly created in Photoshop.

The general gameplay idea is cooperative platformer/puzzle solving with friends or other internet anons.

It is running live @ http://uncreative.korny.cc

Mobile devices are also supported, but there might be some scaling issues.


How to run it locally
---------------------
Assuming you have node.js installed, npm install && npm start should fetch all deps and run a local instance.

Code structure
--------------
Backend / persist logic at [ app.js ](app.js)

Game logic mostly at the [public/javascript/*](public/javascript/) folder
