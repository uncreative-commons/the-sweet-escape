			<h2>About</h2>
			<p><strong>The Sweet Escape</strong> was the <em>Hellenic Game Jam 2013</em> entry by <strong>UNCREATIVE COMMONS</strong>.</p>
			<p>Through the player's intervention, a piece of candy  about to be wrapped, unwrapped and sucked upon may or may not be saved from certain death. But freedom doesn't come for free and sometimes it takes a little team effort.</p>
			<p>This sweet post-modern massive-multiplayer online puzzle platformer has been conjured up in the minds of Raz, Flow, Spyro and wizgrav.</p>
